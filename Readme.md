#Just a repository to practice Git and GitHub...
You can either add documentations on technologies, you can add your basic programs in any languages, you can add your projects or, if you don't have any of the above, just read all the steps, you will get to know the steps for contribution and I have a surprise at the end ;)

How to contribute?

 1: Fork this repository and name it according to you.
 2: Copy the URL.
 3: Open a folder in your PC where you want to store the files and folder.
 4: Right click and click Git Bash here.
 5: Once the terminal opens, type in git clone url (here, paste the url)
 6: Close git bash.
 7: To add something like your project or basic codes or documentation;
    a: Create your own folder by a specific name of choice.
    b: Add your files or folder according to your need with proper names.
 8: In the main folder, again click git bash here(main folder is by the name of your fork)
 9: Follow the commands given below;
    a: type in - git checkout -b"Branch-name"
               "Branch-name"->"type any branch name without space in between"
    b: type in - git add . or git add filename.extension
               filename.extension can be name.txt or something like this.
    c: type in - git commit m-"Message"
               "Message"->"Type anything that specifies your change and can have space in between"
    d: type in - git push origin branchname
               type your branch name on which your are right now.
 10: open your forked repository.
 11: You will find compare and pull request, click on it.
 12: Submit the pull request after the page is opened.

 Before pushing the changes, I would like you to add your name and github profile url in the contributors.md file. Neither on the top nor in bottom, Somewhere in the middle.

 Those who don't have anything to push in the repository, documentation or files or project, can simply just add their name and profile url in contributors.md file.


 And done....! Here it is, your own contribution to the open source community.
 Whatever it is, celebrate and tell your friends who are just starting with git and github.
